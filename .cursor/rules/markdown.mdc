# Markdown Writing Rules

## Linting and Quality

- Always lint all .md files
- Use fenced code blocks with language specification
- Ensure blank lines around code blocks and lists
- Use consistent heading hierarchy

## List Formatting

- DO NOT USE NUMBERED HEADINGS
- Prefer unnumbered lists to numbered lists, especially if numbered lists are expected to change, or you get lint errors
- Numbered lists are still good if there is an explicit (and important) sequence to follow
- Use consistent list markers (- for unnumbered, 1. for numbered)

## Documentation Maintenance

- When making large scale code changes, review all .md files for accuracy
- Update documentation when making changes to ensure it stays current
- Verify existing .md files are current and accurate - do not assume they are canonical

## Examples

### Good Examples

- Use unnumbered lists for flexible content
- Use numbered lists only for sequential steps
- Always specify language in fenced code blocks

### Code Block Example

```java
// Always specify the language
public class Example {
    // Code here
}
```

## Project doc layout

`/README.md`
`/INSTALL.md`
`/BUILD.md`
`/plans/*` - stuff in progress (not commited to repo)
`/docs/*` - dev oriented docs, focus on current state, not history. Omit editorials and past time dependent information like "Resolved" or "Fixed".
